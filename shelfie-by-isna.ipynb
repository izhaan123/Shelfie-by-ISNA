      "(30, 'I, Robot', 'Science Fiction', 'A collection of short stories explores the ethical and philosophical implications of robots with artificial intelligence. The stories examine the Three Laws of Robotics and the challenges of creating machines that can think and act independently. The characters are scientists, engineers, and robots, each grappling with the complexities of artificial intelligence. The narrative is thought-provoking and engaging, raising questions about the nature of consciousness, morality, and the future of humanity. It is a classic of science fiction, exploring themes of technology, ethics, and the relationship between humans and machines. The setting is a future world where robots are integrated into everyday life, reflecting the potential benefits and risks of artificial intelligence. The story is a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the importance of considering the ethical implications of technology.', 'Isaac Asimov')\n",
