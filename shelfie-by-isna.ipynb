    "University and public libraries often house extensive collections of books, but students and patrons struggle to efficiently navigate these collections through traditional search portals. Current systems typically rely on keyword-based search with limited natural language understanding, making it difficult for users to:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Understand availability without manual filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make reservations or join waitlists seamlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get personalized or popular recommendations\n",
    "\n",
